# Sampling mode configuration:
#   - sample_proportional (default): weight is a multiplier relative to uniform sampling by sample count
#     e.g., weight=2.0 means 2x probability compared to uniform sampling
#     A small dataset will naturally have lower probability, weight adjusts it proportionally
#   - weight_only: sampling probability is purely based on weight, ignoring dataset size
#     e.g., all datasets with weight=1.0 have equal probability regardless of size
